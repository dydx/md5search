{"name":"Md5search","tagline":"Trie graphs and MD5 hashes","body":"### Trie graphs and MD5 hashes\r\nUsing a naive implementation of trie graphs in Python, we can store MD5 hashes and plaintext, and relatively quickly traverse the graph to derive plaintext. This is a toy project of mine to look at ways to store strings and do lookups. The use of this tool for nefarious purposes is not explicitly condoned, but I don't personally have any problems with you using it that way. Good luck.\r\n\r\n### Usage:\r\n```\r\n$>python filesystem.py ~/path/to/wordlist.txt\r\n$>Done creating filesystem\r\n$>python search.py\r\n$> Enter an md5 hash to find: 4cb9c8a8048fd02294477fcb1a41191a\r\n$> changeme\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
